bot get proxy 

Here is a brief introduction: this is a free proxy-getting Telegram bot created using Node.js.
To set up the environment, you can install Node.js and use the command npm install axios to set up the bot. I don't have the full code encrypted :)

These are the things that need to be installed for node js setup

npm install node-telegram-bot-api

npm install axios

run node bot.js
